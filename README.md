# Pretty GCSE DigiTech Information Sheets that Gemini Made Me

Gemini 3 makes lovely html information sheets which are aesthetically pleasing, well designed and easy to read.

The only downside is that they don't always convert nicely to docs or PDFs and you can end up with information being split across pages or scaling issues.

Hosting them on GitHub pages means that students get the full benefit of a nicely designed information sheet, and I get the full benefit of not having to spend hours making one.
